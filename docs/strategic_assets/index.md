## Using Strategic Assets 

Strategic Assets represent elements of the Imperium's armies that don't fit neatly into a single Army List or were widespread across the Expeditionary fleets of the Great Crusade. Included in these ranks are the god-engines of the Collegia Titanica and the Knight Banners of the Questoris Familia.

Strategic Assets are not a full Army List and therefore cannot be chosen as the Primary List of an Army. Instead, it encompasses a number of Formations that can be used as Allied Contingents within an Army.

Unless instructed otherwise, any Army can take a Strategic Asset Formation, though some Detachments may have restrictions as to which Army they can be included in, such as armies with a particular Allegiance.
