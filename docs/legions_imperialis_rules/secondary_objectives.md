In addition to the possible ways to score Victory Points described in each Mission, each player has a Secondary Objective. Secondary Objectives are chosen as described [on page 102](../legions_imperialis_rules/fighting_a_battle.md#determine-secondary-objective).

Each of the Secondary Objectives are described over the following pages. If a Secondary Objective requires the placement of an Objective marker, then the marker must be clearly indicated as different from the Mission Objective markers. Any time a Secondary Objective marker is placed, either while setting up the battlefield or during the course of a game, it cannot be placed within an area of Impassable Terrain, overlapping a Structure or overlapping the base of any model. If the marker must be placed but does not meet these rules, move the marker the shortest possible distance to allow it to be placed.

Objective markers placed as part of a Secondary Objective do not score VPs due to the Mission rules - they are used solely for the Secondary Objective. However, players should still determine who is in control of each marker during the End phase of each round.

## Carnage

At the end of the battle, calculate the total points value of enemy Detachments that have been destroyed; Detachments that have lost half or more of their starting models count as half their total points value (rounding down to the nearest whole number).

The player with this Secondary Objective scores VPs depending on the percentage of enemy Detachments that have been destroyed relative to the total starting points value of the enemy Army, as follows: 

* If at least 35% of the total starting points value of the enemy Army has been destroyed, you score 5 VPs.

* If at least 65% of the total starting points value of the enemy Army has been destroyed, you score 10 VPs instead.

* If at least 80% of the total starting points value of the enemy Army has been destroyed, you score 15 VPs instead.

## Vital Intel

At the start of the first round, before any Order tokens are placed, the opponent of the player with this Secondary Objective deploys an Objective marker anywhere as close as possible to the centre of the battlefield. This is the vital intel that must be retrieved. The marker cannot be deployed within an area of Impassable terrain or overlapping a Structure.

If a Detachment controlled by the player with this Secondary Objective ends its activation in the Movement phase within 1" of the Objective marker and more than 1" from any enemy models, it may pick up the Intel - remove the marker from the battlefield. Models with the Flyer special rule, or the Skimmer and Hover special rules, cannot pick up the Intel, though a model carrying it can subsequently Embark upon a Transport with these special rules.

If the Detachment carrying the marker is destroyed, the opposing player places the Objective marker back on the battlefield in the centre of where one model in the Detachment's base was. If the Detachment carrying the Intel was destroyed due to an Overwatch, the opposing player places the Intel marker within 3" of the destroyed model's starting position (i.e., before it began moving). If the Detachment carrying the Intel was destroyed while within an area of Impassable terrain or Structure, the opposing player places the marker in base contact with the boundary of the Impassable terrain/Structure, so it is outside of either.

During the Calculating Victory Points stage of the End phase of any round, a Detachment carrying the marker, or a Transport the Detachment is Embarked upon, that is within 1" of their battlefield edge can recover the Intel - remove that Detachment from the battlefield. This can only be done if the Detachment is in Coherency. The removed Detachment, and any Transports it was Embarked upon, does not count as destroyed but plays no further part in the battle. If a model carrying the Intel leaves the battlefield for any other reason (e.g., due to fleeing), place the Intel marker touching the battlefield edge at the point where the Detachment left the battlefield.

If a model carrying the Intel marker is Embarked upon a Transport with the Flyer special rule and that Transport leaves the battlefield, it also counts as having recovered the Intel; both the Detachment carrying the Intel marker and the Transport play no further part in the battle (i.e., are put to one side).

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores 15 VPs if the Intel has been recovered, 10 VPs if the Intel has not been recovered but is being carried by a friendly Detachment or 5 VPs if the Intel marker is on the battlefield and no enemy models are within 8" of the Objective marker.

## Objectives and Tournaments

Missions and Secondary Objectives add an extra tactical layer to Legions Imperialis, requiring players to push towards completing their own objectives while countering their opponent, who often has a different goal in mind.

If running a tournament, an event organiser may wish to choose which Mission is in play for each game, ensuring all players are playing the same Mission. They can do the same for Secondary Objectives as well, either through letting players choose from one of two pre-selected Secondary Objectives or by assigning a single Secondary Objective for all players.

An alternative option for Secondary Objectives, which allows players more choice, is to create an objective pool. An objective pool is a set of Secondary Objectives that all players can draw from during their games, selecting one when they would normally roll for their Secondary Objective. Once a Secondary Objective has been chosen, it cannot be picked again for the remainder of the event. This means players must carefully choose which Secondary Objective to play when but ensures all players are using the same Secondary Objectives over the course of the event. 

## Control the Battlefield

At the end of the battle, divide the battlefield into equal quarters and calculate the total Tactical Strength ([see page 103](../legions_imperialis_rules/fighting_a_battle.md#capturing-objective-markers)) of each player's models wholly within each quarter. The player with the greatest total Tactical Strength in each quarter is said to be in control of it - if the total Tactical Strength is the same, no player controls it.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores 5 VPs if they control at least one battlefield quarter, 10 VPs if they control at least two battlefield quarters and 15 VPs if they control three or more battlefield quarters.

## Breakthrough

At the start of the first round, before any Order tokens are placed, the player with this Secondary Objective secretly notes down up to five friendly Detachments that are either deployed on the battlefield or Embarked within a Transport to be carrying some supplies. Models with the Flyer special rule cannot be chosen, nor can models Embarked upon a Transport with the Flyer special rule.

During the Calculating Victory Points stage of the End phase of any round, a Detachment carrying supplies that is within 1" of the enemy battlefield edge can break through the enemy line - remove that Detachment from the battlefield. The removed Detachment does not count as destroyed but plays no further part in the battle. A Transport that has a Detachment carrying supplies Embarked within it may leave the battlefield in this way with the Detachment inside - both the Transport and any Embarked Detachment play no further part in the battle if this happens.

Models Embarked within a Flyer cannot leave the battlefield in this way.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores 5 VPs if one friendly Detachment carrying supplies broke through the enemy line, 10 VPs if two friendly Detachments carrying supplies broke through the enemy line and 15 VPs if three or more friendly Detachments carrying supplies broke through the enemy line.

## Plant the Standard Defiant

At the start of the first round, before any Order tokens are placed, the player with this Secondary Objective nominates one of their models, whether on the battlefield or in Reserve, to be carrying a standard. Titans and models with the Flyer, Hover and/or Transport special rule cannot be chosen to carry the standard, nor can they pick it up in battle.

At the end of its activation in any Movement phase, the model carrying the standard may plant it - place an Objective marker in base contact with the model from the Detachment. The marker must be placed so it is wholly within 12" of your opponent's battlefield edge (or 18" if playing the Forward Push Mission) or the standard cannot be planted.

Once the standard has been planted, it functions like a normal Secondary Objective marker.

If the model carrying the standard is destroyed, place a marker on the battlefield, where the centre of the base of the model was. A friendly model that ends its activation in the Movement phase within 1" of the marker can pick up the standard - remove the marker from the battlefield. Once a standard has been deliberately planted, it cannot be picked up again.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores 5 VPs if the standard is being carried by a friendly Detachment but has not been planted, 10 VPs if the standard has been planted but is contested or 15 VPs if the standard has been planted, is uncontested and under your control.

If the standard is under the opposing player's control or is not being carried and has not been planted, you score no VPs.

## Defiant

At the end of the battle, calculate the total Tactical Strength ([see page 103](../legions_imperialis_rules/fighting_a_battle.md#capturing-objective-markers)) of each player's models wholly within the deployment zone of the player with this Secondary Objective.

The player with the greatest total Tactical Strength in the deployment zone is said to be in control of it - if the total strength is the same, no player controls it.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores 15 VPs if no enemy models are within their deployment zone and no enemy Detachments are within 12" of their battlefield edge (18" if playing the Forward Push mission), 10 VPs if the total Tactical Strength of friendly models in their deployment zone is double that of the total Tactical Strength of enemy models, or 5 VPs if the total Tactical Strength of friendly models within their deployment zone is greater than the total Tactical Strength of enemy models within the player's deployment zone.
