**TERRAIN**

![](../media/image336.png){width="9.448832020997376in"
height="12.992165354330709in"}

here were many different types of battlefields
fought over during the Horus Heresy, from desolate

wastelands to dense, war-torn cities, and everything in between. ln
Legions Imperialis, the features of these battlefieldsare represented
by terrain.

On the battlefield,terrain is definedin terms of 'areas'. These are
sections of the battlefieldthat are affected by certain rules. These
areas will be represented by some form of miniature and/or modelled
scenery, such as the Citadel Civitas Imperialis buildings. The type of
terrain
an area represents should be easily identifiableby both players - an
area of forest should contain trees, an area of river should look like
a river, etc.

Terrain can take many forms. ln some instances, such as when using
buildings, the extent of the terrain is obvious. However, in others,
such as a forest or swamp, the edge of the terrain might be less
clear. As such, at the start of the battle, before deployment, players
should decide between themselves which areas of the battlefieldare
areas of terrain, what type of terrain it is and its exact boundaries.

The area a piece of terrain occupies is determined by
specificboundaries that players definebefore the game begins - for
example, the base the trees are on might represent the area of the
battlefieldcovered by that forest, even if that base is not entirely
covered by trees. Any model within this area is affected by the
terrain's rules, regardless of whether, for example, a model is
walking
over a flat section of that area or a rocky section.

Terrain

This section covers different types of terrain and how they affect
Detachments on the battlefield.lt looks at the most common categories of
terrain, such as Difficultor lmpassable terrain, as well as terrain
sub-types of those categories, which are subject to additional rules.

Any area of the battlefieldnot definedas a specificarea
of terrain is referred to as 'Open terrain'. This includes
not just wide open plains, but also hills and other natural features
that offer little impediment. Open terrain
confers no advantage or disadvantage to models within
it, however, it can still block line of sight - for example,
a hill might hide models behind it, but a model that is visible on top
of the hill gains no particular advantages
or disadvantages.

**Cover Saves**
Many areas of terrain grant models within them
a Cover Save. These are Save characteristics that are not modifiedby
AP, i.e., a model with a Cover Save of 6+ will always have a value of
6+ available to it, unless a rule specificallyignores Cover
Saves. Cover Saves can be used when making Save rolls. Remember, a
model can choose which Save characteristic they use for a Save roll
but can only ever make a single Save roll per Hit.

**TYPES OF TERRAIN**
All areas of terrain have a type which determines the special rules
that apply to it and any models that are within the area of terrain.
Each type broadly defines what an area of terrain does. The most
common types of terrain, as well as their effects, are described in
this section. Additional types of terrain may be explored in future
supplements.

![](../media/image338.png){width="9.448832020997376in"
height="12.992165354330709in"}**DiFFiCULT TERRAIN**
Cracked wastelands, rubble-strewn city streets and feculent bogs are
all examples of landscapes that are difficultto cross.

Difficultterrain slows down most Detachments moving through it - for
every i' a model, other than an Infantry or Walker model, moves
through an area of terrain

designated as Difficultterrain, they count as having moved 2'.
Infantry and Walker models move through an area of Difficultterrain
without penalty.

When a Detachment chooses an enemy Detachment
with at least one model wholly within an area of Difficult terrain as
a target, they suffer a -i to all Hit rolls made against that enemy
Detachment, unless the enemy Detachment is a Titan. lf some of the
Detachment's models are in the area of Difficultterrain and some are
not, then the firingDetachment can choose to ignore this
-i modifier.However, if they do so, any resulting Hits can only be
allocated to models not wholly within the area
of terrain.

Models wholly within an area of Difficultterrain gain a Cover Save of
6+.

**Designer's Note: Areas of Terrain**
Given the scale of Legions Imperialis, the exact appearance of a piece
of terrain might not necessarily equate to what it is representing; in
other words, an area of terrain might represent a forest but contain
only a handful of model trees, so models can be placed within it,
whereas its real-life equivalent would contain hundreds or thousands
of them.

Some terrain types have specificeffects on line of sight, as detailed in
the section that follows. lf the area of terrain has no specificrules
related to line of sight then it only blocks it if a piece of the
terrain (such as a large rock or network of pipes) hides a model. This
may seem abstract but it allows for
easy resolution of how terrain affects models on the battlefield.The key
thing to remember is all pieces
of terrain occupy an area, regardless of their physical appearance over
that definedarea.

*LIR67.1: A selection of areas of terrain the boundaries of each are
marked in blue.*

**OBSTRUCTING TERRAIN**
Obstructing terrain includes a variety of different terrain areas,
including stretches of ruins, craters and areas
of woodland. Regardless of features, each represents
a portion of the battlefieldthat provides cover to Detachments within
the area.

An area of Obstructing terrain follows all the rules for
![](../media/image339.png){width="9.448832020997376in"
height="12.992165354330709in"}Difficultterrain with the following
exceptions:

Models wholly within an area of Obstructing terrain
gain a 5+ Cover Save instead of the usual 6+. ln addition, the -i to
Hit rolls made when firingat a Detachment within Obstructing terrain
applies to all Detachment types, including Titans.

Models cannot draw line of sight through an area
of Obstructing terrain. All models within an area
of Obstructing terrain more than i' from the area's boundaries are
hidden from view. Models that are hidden in this way are considered
out of line of sight to models outside of the area of Obstructing
terrain. As such,
they cannot be chosen as a target by enemy Detachments if line of
sight is required when firing,nor can they target models outside of
the area of terrain.

Models within the same area of Obstructing terrain can draw line of
sight to each other as normal. lf firingon a Detachment in the same
area of Obstructing terrain, then the firingmodels suffer the usual -i
penalties to Hit rolls due to firingat a model in Difficultterrain and
the target can use the 5+ Cover Save.

Models with the Flyer special rule can draw line of sight to any model
within an area of Obstructing terrain, even if they are hidden.
However, the penalties to Hit for models being in an area of
Obstructing terrain still apply.

**DANGEROUS TERRAIN**
Toxic sludge, lava flows, minefieldsand xenos-infested warrens are all
examples of terrain that can prove deadly to any attempting to cross it.

An area of terrain designated as Dangerous terrain
can damage Detachments moving through it during
the Movement phase. lf at least one model from a Detachment moves
through an area of terrain designated as Dangerous terrain, then the
Detachment suffers damage. At the end of the Detachment's activation,
it suffers a Hit for each full i' it moved through the area
of Dangerous terrain - use the model that has moved
the greatest distance through the terrain to calculate the total number
of Hits scored. These Hits originate in a model's Front Arc and have an
AP of o. Only models that have moved through the area of terrain can be
allocated any Hits scored; if these Hits cause more Wounds than models
that have moved through the area of Dangerous terrain, the excess Wounds
are discarded.

When a Detachment chooses an enemy Detachment with at least one model
wholly within an area of Dangerous terrain as a target, the
firingDetachment suffers a -i
to all Hit rolls made against that enemy Detachment, unless that enemy
Detachment is a Titan. lf some of the target Detachment's models are in
the area of Dangerous terrain and some are not, then the
firingDetachment can choose to ignore this -i modifier.However, if they
do so, any resulting Hits can only be allocated to models not wholly
within the area of terrain.

Dangerous terrain does not grant Cover Saves.

**OBSTACLES**
Low walls, tank traps and promethium pipelines are all examples of
obstacles, which should be no more than
2' in height and 2' in width. The area of battlefieldthe Obstacle
occupies is definedsolely by the miniature it is represented by.

Any model can move over an Obstacle, but a model that
![](../media/image340.png){width="9.448832020997376in"
height="12.992165354330709in"}does so counts as having moved a number
of extra inches equal to the height of the Obstacle. A model cannot
end
its move on top of an Obstacle unless it has a Scale of 5 or higher. A
model firingat a target with a Detachment Scale of 3 or lower in base
to base contact with an Obstacle suffers a -i to all Hit rolls if part
of the target model is obscured from the firingmodel by the Obstacle
(e.g., the legs of one or more figureson the base,
part of a tank's hull, etc.).

A model issued with a Charge Order may Engage enemy models within i'
of the other side of an Obstacle, without moving over the Obstacle. To
do so, they must move into base contact with the Obstacle in question
and have line
of sight to the model they wish to Engage - any enemy model that is on
the other side of the Obstacle and within i' of the Obstacle is now
Engaged, or Engaged & Pinned, with the charging model, as if they were
in base to base contact. Models fightingan enemy model on the other
side of an Obstacle do not gain the +i to their Fight rolls for being
issued with a Charge Order.

**Reinforced Obstacles**
Certain Obstacles, such as tank traps, can be classifiedas Reinforced
Obstacles - players should agree before a game starts as to which
Obstacles are Reinforced and which aren't. A Vehicle or Super-heavy
Vehicle cannot move over an Obstacle designated as a Reinforced
Obstacle.

**IMPASSABLE TERRAIN**
Gigantic alien trees, towering rock formations and valley walls are just
some examples of lmpassable terrain - areas that are all but impossible
to traverse in the midst of battle.

As the name suggests, models cannot move through an area of terrain
designated as lmpassable terrain unless instructed otherwise (such as
models with the Flyer special rule). lf a model is forced to move into
an area of terrain designated as lmpassable terrain, it stops at the
terrain's edge and can go no further. Unless instructed otherwise, a
model's base cannot overlap any part of lmpassable terrain.

**Combining Terrain Areas**
Terrain pieces can be combined to create an area of terrain with
different properties at different places on the terrain - a Structure
within a jungle for example, or a river of lava running through an
area of Difficultterrain. Where this is the case, each area should be
clearly definedbefore the battle begins,
so all players know where one area of terrain begins and the other
ends. A model is only affected by the rules of the terrain it is in.

*For example, an area of River cuts through a wood* *(Obstructing
terrain). While models are moving through* *the wood, they are
affected by the rules for Obstructing* *terrain; they gain the
appropriate Cover Save, their* *Movement is slowed, depending on the
Detachment*
*type, and enemy models firingat them suffer the*
*relevant penalties to hit.*

When a Structure is placed in an area of Obstructing terrain, players
may agree that the Structure is larger than the terrain. lf they do,
the Obstructing terrain does not block line of sight
to Detachments Garrisoned within the Structure, nor does it block line
of sight for Detachments outside the Obstructing terrain that wish to
target the Structure.

**RiVER**
Rivers are traditionally areas of water that stretch across the
battlefield,though the wide variety of galactic battlefieldsmight mean
they contain flowing rivers of acid, alien bio-fluid or warp-tainted
blood.

Rivers should start at a point on a battlefieldedge and end at a
different point on a battlefieldedge or another water
![](../media/image341.png){width="9.448832020997376in"
height="12.992165354330709in"}feature (such as a lake). The width of a
River can vary, however it should be no wider than 6' at any point.

A River counts as Dangerous terrain to Infantry, Cavalry and Walkers,
lmpassable terrain to Vehicles and Super- heavy Vehicles and Open
terrain to Knights and Titans.

Areas along the River can be designated as Fords or be crossed by
Bridges. A Detachment other than Knights and Titans crossing a River
at a Ford treats the River as

Difficultterrain instead, while it remains Open terrain for Knights
and Titans.

Bridges are areas of Open terrain that allow Detachments to cross a
River. A Bridge can be targeted as if it were a Structure with an
Armour Save characteristic of 5+ and
3 Wounds. lf a Bridge is destroyed, any model on it must pass a Save
roll using its Armour Save characteristic or be destroyed. A model not
destroyed is moved the shortest possible route to a spot outside of
the River's area.

**CLiFFS**
The boundaries of an area of Cliff terrain are referred
to as the Cliff Face. The Cliff Face is lmpassable to all Detachments
except Infantry, effectively meaning most Detachments cannot move
through an area of terrain designated as a Cliff.

Infantry can scale the Cliff Face, moving over it in the
same way a model moves over an Obstacle, with a height equal to the
height of the terrain piece - a Cliff Face must be at least 2' in
height. lf an Infantry model has enough movement remaining to scale the
Cliff Face, it is placed over the area of terrain's boundaries. A model
must scale the Cliff Face in a single turn, and cannot end it 'halfway
up' a Cliff Face. Models with the Jump Packs or Skimmer special rules
(see pages 93 and 95, respectively) can move over the Cliff Face but
must have enough movement to do so (e.g., if the Cliff Face is 4' tall,
a model with the Jump Packs or Skimmer special rule must have 4' of
movement remaining to move over the boundary, instead of ignoring it
like other Obstacles).

Models in an area of Cliff can move as if in Open terrain, and can spend
any movement they have remaining after scaling the Cliff Face. To move
out of the area of terrain, models must scale the Cliff Face again,
moving over the boundary and being placed touching the outside of it.
As models that are already in an area of Cliff are treated
as if in Open terrain, any model can be deployed in the area of terrain,
even if it could not normally cross its boundaries. Additionally, a
model can be placed over
the boundary through other means (e.g., due to a model arriving on the
battlefielddue to the Deep Strike special rule or Disembarking from a
Transport with the Flyer special rule), and act normally. However, the
Cliff Face remains lmpassable if the model cannot normally cross it,
meaning the model cannot cross the Cliff Face boundary unless through
other means.

*th Legion, the Stor-Bezashk were tasked* *with the maintenance,
construction and use of the* *deadly siege weapons and singular relics

Stor-Bezashk served both as a specialised* *siege breaking force in
its own right and, broken into its* *component parts, as specialised
reinforcements for the* *Iron Warriors Grand Battalions in the field.*

**STRUCTURES**
Towering city spires, fortified bunkers and promethium processing
plants are all examples of Structures.

Each individual Structure is its own area of terrain. Unless
instructed otherwise, a Structure blocks line of sight and is classed
as lmpassable terrain to all models except Infantry. Infantry
Detachments can Garrison Structures - see page 72 for more details.

Impassable Terrain Structure

Obstacle

Structure Structure Structure

*LIR71.1: A series of areas of Terrain constructed using Civitas
terrain sets, detailing examples of Structures or non-Structures.*

Structures are subject to additional special rules depending on their
type. A Structure's type is determined before the start of each game
alongside all other pieces of terrain. Each Structure is assigned a
type from the table below, based upon its size and 'function':

**Structure**
**Bonus Cover Save**

Civitas Imperialis 5+ i 2 -2 to Hit rolls

+2 CAF

Militas Imperialis 3+ 2 3 -2 to Hit rolls

+3 CAF

Imperialis Grandus 4+ 3 3 -2 to Hit rolls

+2 CAF

Fortification 2+ i 2 -2 to Hit rolls

+3 CAF

As shown in the table, each Structure type has a set of
characteristics associated with it:

4+

4+

3+

' The Armour Save (Sv) characteristic represents how structurally
sound a Structure is and how likely it is to resist

incoming fire.
' The Garrison Number (GN) describes the maximum number of Detachments
which can Garrison a Structure of that

type. The number of models within a Detachment does not matter, only
the number of Detachments Garrisoned in
a Structure.

' The Wounds characteristic represents how much damage a Structure can
take before it collapses.
' The Structure Bonus characteristic is a set of modifiersthat applies
to models and Detachments that are Garrisoned

inside the building. Models firingupon a Detachment Garrisoned within
a Structure suffer a penalty to their Hit rolls
as shown in the table. ln addition, models Garrisoned within a
Structure gain a bonus to their CAF characteristic equal to the value
shown in the table.

' All models Garrisoned within a Structure gain a Cover Save
characteristic equal to the value shown in the Cover

Save column.

**STRUCTURES IN THE MOVEMENT PHASE**
An area of terrain designated as a Structure counts as lmpassable
terrain to all Detachments except Infantry. Most Structures allow
Infantry to Garrison within them.

**Garrisoning Structures**
Infantry models can move through a Structure as if it
were Open terrain, or a Detachment of Infantry can
![](../media/image348.png){width="9.448832020997376in"
height="12.992165354330709in"}choose to Garrison the Structure. Unless
a model's Detachment intends to Garrison a Structure, it cannot
end its movement overlapping the Structure's area. Infantry
Detachments can be deployed Garrisoned within a Structure, so long as
the Structure is completely within the player's deployment zone.

To Garrison a Structure, a Detachment must end its activation with at
least half (rounding up) of the total number of models within the
Detachment in base
contact with the building during the Movement phase. The controlling
player then declares that the Detachment is Garrisoning the Structure,
so long as an enemy Detachment is not currently Garrisoned within it.
lf possible, place a model from the Detachment on top of the Structure
to indicate it is Garrisoned or use a token
or similar marker if a model cannot be placed on top of
the Structure. Any models that cannot be placed on top
of the Structure are placed to the side of the battlefield (but do not
count as destroyed). Once a Detachment
has Garrisoned a Structure, it cannot move any further that phase.

Each Structure has a maximum number of Detachments that can Garrison
within it at any one time, determined by the Structure's Garrison
Number (GN). Other friendly models can still move through a Structure
even if the maximum possible number of Detachments have Garrisoned
it - these models simply cannot end their movement overlapping the
Structure's area.

A model that is Garrisoned within a Structure can move as normal in
subsequent phases and treats the entire area of the Structure as its
base. When moving out of a Structure, Garrisoned models choose a point
on the Structure and measure from there. lf one model from a
Detachment moves out of a Structure, then the entire Detachment
must do so as well, and it is no longer Garrisoning
the Structure.

**Engaging Garrisoned Structures**
Models Garrisoned within Structures have no
Engagement Zone. However, models cannot move
through a Structure Garrisoned by enemy models,
nor can they end their movement in base contact with
the Structure unless they are an Infantry model issued
with a Charge Order, a Titan or a model that has a weapon with the
Wrecker trait (see page 85). Models in base to
base contact with a Structure count as Engaged with all enemy
Detachments Garrisoned within the Structure. Unless instructed
otherwise, other Detachment types
do not count as Engaged with Garrisoned Detachments and thus both can
fireas normal in a subsequent phase, including at one another if
eligible to do so.

**Structure Types**
On the battlefield,the term 'Structure' covers all manner of
constructions, from armoured bunkers
to towering city spires and everything in between. To facilitate the
myriad possible designs, Structures are organised into broad
categories that cover
nearly anything a player can conceive of and build. These categories
also help speed up gameplay,
with Structures being easily identifiableand their characteristics
determined at a glance.

Civitas Imperialis represents buildings commonly seen in lmperial
cities across the galaxy and is aptly represented by the terrain range
of the same name. Militas Imperialis represents military structures,
such as command centres or structures converted into temporary
bastions. Imperialis Grandus represent landmarks, such as sprawling
monuments to the lmperial Truth or governmental buildings. Lastly,
Fortifications represent structures such as Bunkers and other
dedicated defensive points.

lf players wish, they can add further depth to Structures. This can be
done by tying a Structure's Garrison Number to its size - the larger a
building, the greater its GN. The size of Structure should be
determined by the area of the battlefieldit occupies. A good rule of
thumb for a civilian Structure is if it
is at least 2'x2' in size then it has a GN of i, if it is at least
4'x4' in size it has a GN of 2, and if it is at least 6'x6' in
size, it has a GN of 3. Similar rules can be applied to other
Structure types.

**STRUCTURES IN THE COMBAT PHASE**
Structures can be targeted and firedupon as if they were a Detachment,
although not all weapons can damage Structures. ln addition, models
Garrisoned within a Structure have additional rules that apply to them
when Firing or being firedupon.

**Targeting Structures**
![](../media/image349.png){width="9.448832020997376in"
height="12.992165354330709in"}Models can nominate Structures as a
target when Firing as if it were a Detachment, so long as it meets all
other requirements for an eligible target. A Structure does not need
to have a Detachment Garrisoned within it to be chosen as a target.

When a Structure is chosen as a target, make Hit rolls as normal,
adding i to the result of all Hit rolls made.

A Structure can only be damaged by certain weapons
- any Hit caused against a Structure is automatically discarded before
Save rolls are made, unless the weapon

has a Trait that explicitly states it can damage Structures (for
example, Heavy Barrage or Demolisher).

The opposing player then makes a Save roll for each Hit that is
scored. Save rolls for Structures are made using 2D6. After applying
any modifiers,including the weapon's AP characteristic, compare the
result against the Armour Save characteristic of the Structure.

lf the result is equal to or greater than the Structure's Armour Save
characteristic, no damage is done and the Hit is discarded. lf the
result of the roll is less than the Structure's Armour Save
characteristic, the Structure suffers a Wound. lf a Structure drops to
o Wounds,
it collapses.

**Collapsing Structures**
When a Structure collapses, it is removed from the battlefieldand
replaced with an area of Difficultterrain that occupies roughly the same
area as the Structure.
lf any models were Garrisoned within the Structure,
each model Garrisoned within the Structure automatically suffers a Hit
and makes a Save roll as normal - this hit has an AP of -i. Any model
that fails this Save roll is destroyed, regardless of the number of
Wounds it has.

Any model that survives is then placed by the controlling player within
the new area of Difficultterrain or as close as possible to it if no
space remains.

**Structures and Firing**
Models Garrisoned within a Structure may fireat enemy Detachments as
normal. When firing,models Garrisoned within a Structure treat the
entire area of the Structure
as their base, and can draw line of sight from any point of the
Structure.

Similarly, enemy models may fireupon Detachments Garrisoned within a
Structure, as long as they can see part of the Structure and are within
range of that part. lf more than one Detachment is Garrisoned within a
Structure, then the firingplayer must nominate which Detachment or
Detachments are the target. Any Hit rolls made against Detachments
Garrisoned within a Structure suffer negative modifiersto their Hit
rolls, depending on the Structure Type - see the Structure Bonus column
on the Structure table on page 7i.

**Structures and Fights**
lf one or more Detachments are Engaged with one or more enemy
Detachments that are Garrisoned within a Structure, then those
Detachments are in a Combat.

Fights involving Garrisoned models are resolved as normal, with models
paired off as described in the Combat section (see page 54). Any model
in base contact
![](../media/image350.png){width="9.448832020997376in"
height="12.992165354330709in"}with a Structure counts as being in base
contact with all models within the Structure for the purposes of
pairing off Fights, and thus are paired off accordingly.

As normal, the player with lnitiative determines which models are
paired off with one another. Models must first be paired off into
one-on-one Fights. lf all of a player's models have been paired off
into one-on-one Fights and the other player still has models not
paired off, then the player with lnitiative pairs off these models
into two-on- one Fights, then three-on-one Fights and so on, until all
models have been paired off.

ln other words, models can only be paired off against multiple enemy
models if one player has excess models, at which point the number of
models that can be paired off against each enemy model increases by i.

Models that are Garrisoning a Structure gain bonuses
to their CAF characteristic depending on the type of Structure they are
Garrisoned within. The bonus they gain is shown in the Structure Bonus
column of the Structure table on page 7i.

Detachments Garrisoned within a Structure only have
to make a Morale check and Withdraw if they lose the Combat and at least
one enemy model is in base contact

with the Structure; if the Garrisoned Detachments lost the Combat but no
enemy model is in base contact with the Structure, then no Morale checks
are made and the Garrisoned Detachments do not Withdraw. Otherwise, they
Withdraw as normal.

lf all Detachments Garrisoning a Structure are destroyed during a Combat
or Withdraw after the Combat is resolved, any enemy Infantry Detachment
that was Engaged with them may immediately Garrison the Structure. For a
Detachment to Garrison the Structure,
it must have at least one model in base contact with it.

**Targeting Structures**
For the purposes of choosing a target for a firing model, rules that
refer to models and Detachments also apply to the Structure. For
example, if a weapon targets all Detachments within 4' of the
firingmodel and can also damage Structures,
then all Structures within 4' are included as part of the attack.
Where exceptions are made, such as in the case of splitting the dice
of a Titan's weapon
(see page 76), it will be noted.
