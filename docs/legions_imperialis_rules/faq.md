**A.** No.

***Designer's Note:** When moving a Detachment, players should establish the start and end point of a move first, then once the 'line of movement' of each model from start point to end point has been determined, the opponent can select at which point along this line of movement the Overwatch will take place. Regardless of the point along the line of movement that the Overwatch takes place, players should assume that the move is completed before any destroyed models are removed (and, if that model has the Transport (X) special rule, any transported models can still be placed in Detachment Coherency with the rest of their Detachment).*

**A.** Yes.

---

**Q.** Are large movable elements, such as the doors on Drop Pods, considered to be 'insignificant elements' for the purposes of measuring distances?

**A.** No.
