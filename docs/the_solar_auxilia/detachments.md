*across the war-torn galaxy.*

*Solar Auxilia Tactical Command Sections are specialists in
battlefield command and control. They facilitate the flow of orders,
direct the Tercio's actions and co-ordinate artillery and orbital
operations. The section includes several Companion specialists
including the Proclaimator, a junior communications officer, and the
Vexilarius, a warrior who has earned the*

*honour, by virtue of their skill or feats of bravery, of bearing the
unit's standard.*

###### CORE DETACHMENTS {#core-detachments-2 .unnumbered}

*Solar Auxiliaries are recruited from all over the Imperium, from
void-born asteroid miners and the children of noble families to
underhive scum and the incarcerated, and such cultures are the*

*fuel of the Imperium's growth. Those pressed into the Emperor's
service that display the right combination of aggression, discipline
and skill-at-arms are earmarked for the Solar Auxilia*

*cohorts, affording them an undreamed-of escape from an unfulfilling
past into a life of service across the myriad battlefields of the
war-*

*torn galaxy.*

*The Solar Auxilia is defined by the rigid discipline and
well-equipped nature of its soldiers, representing the forefront of
the Imperial Army and, in lieu of a force of Legiones Astartes, the
finest warriors within a given Expeditionary fleet. The*

*rank and file Solar Auxilia infantry were often deployed in Infantry
Tercios, flexible sub-groups formed around a core of Auxiliaries armed
with lasguns and as capable fighting in 'Zone Mortalis' environments
as they were launching massed assaults across the galaxy's most
hostile battlefield.*

[]{#_bookmark39 .anchor}**SUPPORT DETACHMENTS**

*Charonites are biochemically and cybernetically altered Ogryn
abhumans, mutilated in mind and body and left entirely creatures of
brute obedience and drug-induced frenzy. The technology*

*used in their creation is considered proscribed by the Mechanicum,
but, thanks to their strong connection to the Saturnyne enclaves of
Terra and the celestial keeps of Pavonis, the Solar Auxilia retained a
dispensation*

*for the creation and use of Charonites in limited*

*numbers. As the Horus Heresy raged, many Solar Auxilia commands
turned to the creation of Charonites to strengthen their forces to
match against the power of Traitor Legiones Astartes and Dark
Mechanicum forces, although the difficulty of their creation ensured
they did not become widespread.*

*The Veletarii are the most skilled and dedicated warriors in the
Solar Auxilia, often serving as their commander's household guard,
under*

*their direct command. The Veletaris are deployed as shock troops and
as a line reserve, able to shatter the enemy lines or bolster a
wavering defence.*

Automated Sentry

*Infantry sections, providing the tools to combat any foe.*

*The Solar Auxilia use the Tarantula automated weapons platform to
guard exposed flanks and rear line positions where it is judged less
likely that an enemy will attack. They are sometimes pressed into
service in the front line itself when manpower is stretched
dangerously thin.*

*The histories of some of the oldest cohorts contain tales, no doubt
elaborated over the decades, of Tarantula weapons batteries granted
honorary induction into a regiment following a close fought battle
where their presence contributed greatly to the tally of enemy dead.*

###### VANGUARD DETACHMENTS {#vanguard-detachments .unnumbered}

*The Sentinel Walker is a ubiquitous pattern of bipedal walker piloted
by a single individual, employed across the Imperium by both civilian
and military operations.*

*Within the Solar Auxilia, the Aethon Heavy Sentinel was the main fire
support unit available for vanguard units, mounting formidable
weaponry for its size, and also saw use as a heavy*

*reconnaissance unit in hostile environments unsuitable*

*for lighter Sentinels, such as the Hermes. Aethon Heavy Sentinels are
formed into patrols of up to eight walkers, each piloted by a veteran
of a pioneer company, that range ahead of a cohort's main strength, to
locate enemy positions, assess terrain and thwart potential ambushes.*

*To facilitate their role each Aethon Heavy Sentinel can carry an
array of anti- infantry and anti-armour weaponry, with patrols capable
of obliterating*

*the majority of enemy reconnaissance units they might encounter.
Limited power supply and ammunition storage*

*hampered the deployment of Aethon Heavy Sentinels on the front line
and patrols*

*were most commonly used as flanking elements in concert with the main
advance.*

###### BATTLE TANK DETACHMENTS {#battle-tank-detachments-6 .unnumbered}

*A truly ancient design dating back to the wars of the Age of Strife
on Old Earth, the Imperial production model of this heavy tank pattern
was given the name of Malcador the Sigillite, right hand of the
Emperor, during the early days of the Great Crusade when thousands of
these war machines rolled off the production lines of the Forge Worlds
of Mars and Voss. Although not as heavily armed as goliaths such as
the Baneblade or the*

*Stormhammer, the Malcador nevertheless possesses a number of
advantages to its design, the principal of which is its battle speed,
which is truly formidable for a tank*

*of its size thanks to a highly sophisticated, if somewhat
temperamental, drive system. By the time of the Horus Heresy, many
Malcador Heavy Tanks had been relegated to strategic reserves and
second line Imperial Army units, replaced by larger numbers of
smaller, more tactically flexible tanks such as the Leman Russ and its
many variants. The demands of the galaxy-wide civil war soon brought
them back into the fray however, while their availability saw them
used*

*as test-beds for a variety of new variants designed to plug gaps in
supply and resource.*

###### DETACHMENT UPGRADES {#detachment-upgrades-5 .unnumbered}

*The Marauder frame is highly adaptable, leading to the development of
many variants that fulfil operation niches. The most common variation
is the Marauder Destroyer, a ground attack aircraft which sacrifices*

*a portion of its bomb bay capacity in exchange for heavier firepower
-- six*

*nose-mounted autocannons. Marauder Destroyers squadrons are primarily
used to strafe enemy positions during an assault, shattering key
targets in the enemy line or halting enemy flanking assaults. Other
variants include the Marauder Pathfinder, a long-ranged scouting
variant equipped with advanced augurs and tracking systems, and the
Marauder Colossus, designed to destroy high-value targets such as
enemy titans or subterranean facilities through the employment*

*of a guided, high- explosive munition.*
