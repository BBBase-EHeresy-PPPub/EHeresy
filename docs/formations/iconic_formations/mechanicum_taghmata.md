**Defenders of Magma City:** This Formation can only be included in an Army with the Loyalist Allegiance.

**Adaptive Protocols:** When a Detachment from this Formation that has the [Cybernetica Cortex] (X) special rule is activated, its Order may be replaced with a new Order. The new Order must be the same Order as one issued to a friendly Detachment from this Formation that has the [Cybernetica Cortex] (X) special rule within 6" of the activated Detachment. The new Order can be an Order other than those shown in the activated Detachment's [Cybernetica Cortex] (X) special rule, even if the activated Detachment is not within range of a Cyber Controller.
