Throughout the Horus Heresy many groups of warriors became figures of awe, committing mighty or infamous deeds that would ensure their names would be remembered. Iconic Formations represent these groups.

## How to Use Iconic Formations
Each Formation in this section is a special type of Formation referred to as an Iconic Formation. Each Iconic Formation will have a section above the Detachments it can include, formatted as *‘Iconic Formation: Army List name’* to indicate which Army List it is a Formation for.
For example, an Iconic Formation for the Solar Auxilia Army List will have *‘Iconic Formation: Solar Auxilia’* noted above the Detachments it can include. Iconic Formations will sometimes also include Detachments from other Army Lists – unless otherwise stated, these do not count as allies and so do not count towards the Allied Contingents points limit.

Each Iconic Formation consists of two elements: Standard Detachments and Expanded Detachments. When an Iconic Formation is added to your Army Roster, you can either add only the Standard Detachments for the points cost listed, or the Standard Detachments and the Expanded Detachments, paying the total points cost for the Standard Detachments, plus the additional points cost for the Expanded Detachments. A player may choose not to include every Detachment listed under the Expanded Detachments section, but the points cost is not reduced if they do so.

Each Detachment in an Iconic Formation will specify how many models it includes, and which upgrades it has, if any. Such Detachments may not have any additional models added, or be given any other upgrades available to that Detachment.

**Formations of Legend**

Veteran Legions Imperialis players may recognise some of the Formations in this section as previously being Formations of Legend in older supplements. We have taken this opportunity to revisit these Formations and their format and broadened it to now include Formations which are not limited to specific sub-factions. As such, any Formations of Legend in older books are replaced with the Iconic Formations with the same name presented here and should no longer be used.
