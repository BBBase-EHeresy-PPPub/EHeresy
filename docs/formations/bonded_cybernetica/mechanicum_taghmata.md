## Itinerant Cybernetica Cohort

**SUPPORT FORMATION: MECHANICUM TAGHMATA**

**Order Cascade:** Whenever a Detachment in this Support Formation is activated, the controlling player may choose another friendly Detachment from this Support Formation within 6" of the activated Detachment that has already revealed its Order this round. The activated Detachment may discard its Order token and replace it with a new Order chosen from those shown in the Cybernetica Cortex (X) special rule of the chosen friendly Detachment.

All Detachments included in this Support Formation must have the Cybernetica Cortex (X) special rule. Detachments within this Support Formation cannot benefit from the Cortex Controller special rule â€“ they cannot be issued Orders other than those from their variant of the Cybernetica Cortex (X) special rule or another variant through the Order Cascade special rule.
