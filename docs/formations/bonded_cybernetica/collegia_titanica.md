## Collegia Titanica Support Cohorts

**SUPPORT FORMATION: COLLEGIA TITANICA**

**Bound Taghma:** All slots within this Support Formation, apart from Titan Detachment slots, must be filled by Detachments taken from the Mechanicum Taghmata Army List. Non-Core Detachments taken from the Mechanicum Taghmata Army List must have the Cybernetica Cortex (X) special rule.

All Titan Detachments within this Support Formation gain the Cortex Controller special rule. A Titan model from this Support Formation counts its Tactical Strength as equal to its remaining Wounds while within 3" of a non-Titan Detachment from this Support Formation.
