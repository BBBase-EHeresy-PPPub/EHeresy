This section includes a number of additional Formations for the Army Lists found in this publication known as *Support Formations*. All of them are themed around the automata of the Mechanicum Taghmata, representing either unique fighting units under the aegis of the Mechanicum or automata cohorts bound to other military arms of the Imperium.

Each Support Formation also includes suggestions for how you might model and/or paint the Detachments included in it to represent the non-standard nature of the described Formations.

## How to Use Support Formations

For each non-Support Formation in an army, it can include one Support Formation from the same Army List.

*For example, if a Legiones Astartes army has two Formations (e.g., Legion Demi-company and a Legion Armoured Company), it can include a maximum of two Brethren of Iron Support Formations.*

Support Formations cannot be taken as Allied Formations. Each Support Formation will have a section above the Detachments it can include, formatted as *Support Formation: Army List name* to indicate which Army List it is a Support Formation for.
*For example, a Support Formation for the Solar Auxilia Army List will have "Support Formation: Solar Auxilia" noted above the Detachments it can include.*

Support Formations will often include the option to choose Detachments from other Army Lists â€“ unless otherwise stated, these do not count as allies and so do not count towards the Allied Contingents points limit.
