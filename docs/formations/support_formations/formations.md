## Itinerant Cybernetica Cohort

**SUPPORT FORMATION: MECHANICUM TAGHMATA**

**Order Cascade:** Whenever a Detachment in this Support Formation is activated, the controlling player may choose another friendly Detachment from this Support Formation within 6" of the activated Detachment that has already revealed its Order this round. The activated Detachment may discard its Order token and replace it with a new Order chosen from those shown in the [Cybernetica Cortex] (X) special rule of the chosen friendly Detachment.

All Detachments included in this Support Formation must have the [Cybernetica Cortex] (X) special rule. Detachments within this Support Formation cannot benefit from the [Cortex Controller] special rule â€“ they cannot be issued Orders other than those from their variant of the [Cybernetica Cortex] (X) special rule or another variant through the Order Cascade special rule.

## Knight Household Retainer Cohorts

**A Knight Household tightly bound to a Forge World would often rely upon Taghma elements to support its scions on the battlefield.** A common practice was the induction of faster automata such as Vorax and Vultarax into Knight Lances, where the automata would serve as pathfinder and vanguard elements in concert with Knight Armigers.

**SUPPORT FORMATION: KNIGHT HOUSEHOLD**

**Household Vanguard**: All Vanguard Detachment slots within this Support Formation must be filled by Detachments taken from the Mechanicum Taghmata Army List. Detachments taken from the Mechanicum Taghmata Army List must have the [Cybernetica Cortex] (X) special rule.

- Knight Detachments in this Support Formation gain special rules depending on the Compulsory Detachments chosen:

- If all Compulsory Vanguard Detachment slots are filled with Vorax Battle-automata Maniple Detachments, then all Knight Detachments in this Support Formation gain the [Forward Deployment] special rule.

- If all Compulsory Vanguard Detachment slots are filled with Vultarax Stratos-automata Squadron Detachments, then all Knight Detachments in this Support Formation gain the [Outflank] special rule.

Questoris Knight Armiger Talons and Mechanicum Knight Moirax Talons cannot be taken as Detachment Upgrades for Detachments taken in Knight Detachment slots; they may only be selected to fill Armiger Knight Banner slots.

All Questoris Knight Banner and Cerastus Knight Banner Detachments within this Support Formation gain the [Cortex Controller] special rule.
