## Legion Demi-Company

Demi-Companies were the heart of every Legion, formed of several contingents of Tactical Legionaries working in concert with support units. Tactically flexible, Demi-Companies were trained to fight alongside other Legion assets, such as aerial support or armoured units, to ensure battle readiness in the face of myriad threats.

**Dedicated Transports:** Any Legiones Astartes Detachment within the Formation that contains only Infantry models may be upgraded with Legion Rhinos as Dedicated Transports.

**Heart of the Legion:** Compulsory Core Detachment slots in this Formation must be filled with Legion Tactical Detachments. All non-Infantry models within this Formation increase their Tactical Strength by 1 when contesting an Objective marker that an Infantry model within this Formation is also contesting.
