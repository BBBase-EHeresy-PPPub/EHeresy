## The Ist Legion - Dark Angels

**Primogenitor:** Lion El'Jonson

**Cognomen:** (Prior) The Angels of Death, (archaic) The Uncrowned Princes

**Noteworthy Domains:** Caliban, Gramarye, Terran Enclaves or Order dedicated to each discipline of war

**Observed Strategic Tendencies:** None; within the Legion there was at least one Host

**Allegiance:** Fidelitas Constantus

### Legion Special Rules

The following special rules apply to all Dark Angels models in a Legiones Astartes Army.

**Formations of the Hexagrammaton:** At the start of the battle, before any Detachment is deployed, determine which Dark Angels Formations contain a total of three or more different Detachment types - Dedicated Transports are ignored for the purposes of this calculation.

Any Formation that meets these requirements gains one of the following benefits, chosen by the controlling player from the list below:

* All Detachments within the Formation that contain only Dark Angels Infantry models gain the Phosphex and Implacable special rules.

* All Detachments within the Formation that contain only Cavalry models gain the Outflank special rule.

* All Detachments within the Formation that contain only Vehicle models gain the Nimble special rule.

If a Formation has a Dedicated Transport, the model types gain the relevant special rules but the Transports do not.

***For example:** A Dark Angels Formation contains two Legion Tactical Detachments, a Legion Dreadnought Detachment and a Legion Predator Detachment.* *Therefore it meets the requirements of the Formations of the Hexagrammaton special rule and chooses one of the special rules to apply. If the Formation had two Legion Tactical Detachments and two Legion Dreadnought Detachments, it would not meet the requirements, even if the Tactical Detachments had Dedicated Transports.*

## The IIIrd Legion - Emperor's Children

**Primogenitor:** Fulgrim

**Cognomen:** (Prior) None

**Noteworthy Domains:** Chemos (Primary), Terra (Tertiary rights)

**Observed Strategic Tendencies:** Combined Arms Warfare, the use of Complex Manoeuvre and Discursive Tactical Planning, Asymmetrical Assault

**Allegiance:** Traitoris Perdita

### Legion Special Rules

The following special rules apply to all Emperor's Children models within a Legiones Astartes Army.

**Exemplars of War:** Once per battle, an Army that includes at least one Formation consisting entirely of Emperor's Children models (ignoring models within an Allied Contingent) may choose to win Initiative instead of rolling. They must declare they are doing this before rolling. If both players have this rule, the player who did not have Initiative last round chooses if they use the rule first - if they do so, no other player can use it this round.

If an Army includes at least one Allied Contingent comprised entirely of Emperor's Children Detachments then once per battle the controlling player may re-roll the dice roll for Initiative instead. They can only do this if at least one Emperor's Children Detachment is on the battlefield or in Reserve; if all have been destroyed or left the battlefield due to other special rules, this rule has no effect.

In addition, when determining who controls an Objective marker in a deployment zone, Iron Warriors Infantry and Walker models count their Tactical Strength as 2 higher than normal if within their own deployment zone.

*For example, an Iron Warriors Legion Tactical Detachment model would contribute 7 to the total Tactical Strength instead of 5 while in its own deployment zone, for the purposes of determining which player controls an objective within that deployment zone (but not for other reasons unless stated).*

When making Save rolls against these Hits, models count their Save characteristic as equal to their Morale characteristic and cannot use any additional saves, such as an Invulnerable Save, Cover Save, etc., nor can these Hits be allocated to Void Shields. Models that are part of a Detachment that is Broken subtract 2 from the result of these Save rolls.

If a Detachment Engages an enemy Detachment in this way that is in a Combat but has yet to Fight, the Blood Angels Detachment may Fight again this round. Otherwise, do not resolve the Combat.
