###### HQ DETACHMENTS {#hq-detachments-1 .unnumbered}

*Space Marine commanders are the mightiest warriors and battle-leaders
of the Space Marine Legions, second only to the god-like Primarchs in
martial skill and generalship. Within their ranks can be found chapter
masters and lord commanders, first captains, khan and tribunes, as the
traditions of the Legion dictate, as well as Centurions and
specialised commanders providing operational depth and strategic
flexibility.*

*It is common for Space Marine commanders to be accompanied in battle
by a squad of highly disciplined and worthy warriors that serve both
as a bodyguard and are entrusted to carry one of the Legion's
standards.*

###### TRANSPORT DETACHMENTS {#transport-detachments-1 .unnumbered}

*The Rhino is the most widely used armoured personnel carrier in the
Imperium.*

*Based upon ancient STC technology the fundamental design is robust,
reliable and easy to maintain, and its adaptive power plant can run
off a wide variety of fuels. Within the Space Marine Legions, the
Deimos pattern was the most widespread, serving as the basic armoured
transport available to the Legiones Astartes and the foundation from
which*

*a number of other war machines were produced.*

*detachments were frequently augmented by
both mobile fire support units that replaced the utilitarian bolter
with more specialised weapons and more heavily armed units carrying
Space Marine-portable firepower sufficient to bring down hordes of
enemy troops*

*or smash apart armoured vehicles. Thousands of such warriors existed
within every Legion, capable of fighting within the harshest
environments against the deadliest of foes.*

###### DETACHMENT UPGRADES {#detachment-upgrades-1 .unnumbered}

*Tactical units were frequently supported by more specialised Legion
infantry, such as Terminators or Assault Marines. The former possessed
heavily armoured suits capable of weathering almost any form of
attack, making them the ideal spearpoint for assaults upon heavily
fortified positions*

*or in heavy close-quarter fighting. Conversely, Assault Marines
provided a rapid attack force and hit-and-run tactics, harrying the
foe while Tactical units deployed into advantageous firing positions.
Equipped with jump packs that allowed Legionaries to move with great
speed across the battlefield, Assault units were capable of bypassing
intervening terrain and defences to fall upon the enemy from above.*

###### SUPPORT DETACHMENTS {#support-detachments .unnumbered}

*Legion support units were tailored towards specific threats, equipped
with a wide array of mobile fire support weapons or heavy weaponry to
provide Space Marine infantry with the tools necessary to combat any
threat. The deployment of plasma guns as close support weapons became
increasingly common during*

*the Horus Heresy, the weapon favoured for its effectiveness against
enemy Legionaries.*

*The advance of Tactical detachments was often covered by missile
launcher- bearing support units carrying both anti-personnel and
anti-tank missiles who were adaptable to a wide array of threats.*

###### SUPPORT DETACHMENTS {#support-detachments-3 .unnumbered}

*Assault Marines were often fielded in large numbers when rapid ground
assaults were required in terrain- heavy environments. The mobility
offered by the jump pack allowed Legionaries to bypass enemy defences
and descend into the midst of the foe, engaging them in bloody melee.
Legions such as the Raven Guard and Night Lords fielded Assault units
extensively, relying on rapid strike forces to destroy the enemy
before they could respond.*

*Each Space Marine clad in Terminator armour was*

*a veteran of many battles equipped with the finest personal armour
available to the Legions. Though different patterns of Terminator*

*suits existed, all provided extensive protection and were capable of
withstanding almost any form of attack.*

*When deployed en-masse, Terminators were a nigh- unstoppable
avalanche of hardened ceramite that would deliver a hammer blow to
crush the foe with ruthless power.*

###### SUPPORT DETACHMENTS {#support-detachments-4 .unnumbered}

*Rapier carriers are semi- automated tracked weapon carriers with
on-board targeting systems and power generators. Designed to mount
support weapons too cumbersome for even a Space Marine to carry into
battle,*

###### BASTION DETACHMENTS {#bastion-detachments .unnumbered}

*The most common design of automated weapon platforms and sentry gun
batteries utilised by the Imperium's diverse armed forces was*

*the Tarantula, employed primarily for the mundane duties of point
defence and security. The Space Marine Legions make use of Tarantulas
in a forward*

*deployment role and see them as entirely disposable assets, often
utilising them in the thick of battle to defend a forward position,
draw out enemy forces for attack or even to guard a withdrawal or pin
an enemy force during a feint.*

*The Deredeo pattern Dreadnought shares many core components and
systems with the Contemptor Dreadnought but is designed not as an
assault class but rather a heavy weapons*

*platform intended to combine superior firepower with the flexibility
and durability of a Dreadnought chassis.*
