This Mission represents the vanguard of the Salamanders force falling back in the face of the staunch Death Guard resistance to resupply, only to find their way barred by the Iron Warriors, who, instead of covering their retreat, open fire on their erstwhile allies. The Salamanders must break through this trap while holding off the pursuing Death Guard.

### Playing this Mission

This Mission uses the same Mission sequence and rules as the Matched Play Missions found [in the *Legions Imperialis Rulebook*](../legions_imperialis_rules/missions.md), unless otherwise specified in the Mission. Any changes to this process will be listed under the 'Mission Specifics' for that Mission.

In this Mission, one player will be designated as the Attacker and one player as the Defender. Players can either roll off to determine who will be the Attacker or Defender, or simply agree between themselves which player will take which role.

## SLAUGHTER AT THE CRUCIBLE

**Mission Specifics**

In this Mission, the Defender is considered to have control of the battlefield and has two deployment zones. Only Detachments from an Allied Contingent may be deployed by the Defender in the Defender's Allied Deployment Zone. The Attacker must deploy all of their Detachments within the Attacker's deployment zone.

Instead of determining Secondary Objectives as normal:

- The Attacker automatically has the Breakthrough Secondary Objective. This Secondary Objective can only be scored using the Defender's Deployment Zone, and not the Defender's Allied Deployment Zone.
- The Defender automatically has the Defiant Secondary Objective. This Secondary Objective can only be scored using the Defender's Deployment Zone, and not the Defender's Allied Deployment Zone.

**Historical Forces**

If you wish to fight this battle using the forces described in this Journal Strategia, the following should be used:

**Attacker:** The Attacker's Primary Army List should be Legiones Astartes from the Salamanders Legion. They can also optionally include an Allied Contingent from the Solar Auxilia Army List representing the Proximan Sacramentii.

**Defender:** The Defender's Primary Army List should be Legiones Astartes from the Iron Warriors Legion. They can also optionally include an Allied Contingent of Legiones Astartes from the Death Guard Legion.

**Battlefield Terrain**

Instead of setting up terrain as normal, players should utilise a relatively open battlefield, with a few areas of rocky terrain representing the undulating ground of the Urgall Depression. Structures should be avoided if possible; however, the Defender may also deploy up to three small Fortification Structures and up to four sections of Obstacles in the Defender's deployment zone representing the Iron Warriors' hastily assembled fortified positions.

**Objective Markers**

No Objective markers are deployed as part of this Mission.

**Scoring**

Each time a Detachment is destroyed, the player who did not control that Detachment scores 1 Victory Point for every 100 points (rounding up) that Detachment cost when it was added to the controlling player's army. This includes the cost of any other attached models, but does not include the cost of Dedicated Transports. If that Detachment is destroyed during a Combat, the player who did not control that Detachment scores 2 additional Victory Points.

For example, a Legion Kratos Squadron consisting of four models has a points cost of 270 points, and is joined by a Legion Kratos Commander with a points cost of 100 points. The total points cost of this Detachment is 370 points, so when destroyed the opposing player will score 4 Victory Points. If that Detachment was destroyed in a Combat, the opposing player would instead score 6 Victory Points.

**Fleeing**

In this Mission, each player has two battlefield edges. When a Detachment flees, determine which of the controlling player's battlefield edges is closest to the majority of models in that Detachment. Each model in that Detachment must move towards that battlefield edge. If there is no majority, the controlling player should randomise which battlefield edge that Detachment flees towards.
