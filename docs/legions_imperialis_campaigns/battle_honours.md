The battles of the Horus Heresy consumed the galaxy, thrusting the armies of Mankind into internecine conflict.

In this crucible of war, even the most untested warriors swiftly became veterans, learning the skills required to survive and destroy their foes or be consumed by the fires of the Age of Darkness.

Battle Honours are upgrades which can be given to Detachments to provide personalisation and additional abilities or improvements to their characteristics, allowing you to represent famous units from across the Horus Heresy. In this section you will find a series of Battle Honours that can be purchased for each Detachment Type, as well as a new Campaign Expansion allowing your Detachments to gain experience in your campaign battles, in order to gain Battle Honours.

## Gaining Battle Honours

If both players agree, when Mustering Your Army, one Detachment in each Formation in your Army can be upgraded to have Battle Honours. The controlling player selects one of the Battle Honours available to that Detachment and increases the points cost of that Detachment by the amount shown.
