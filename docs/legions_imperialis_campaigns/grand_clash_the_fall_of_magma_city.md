**Mission Specifics**

In this Mission, the attacking Traitor forces are pushing against the defences of Magma City, attempting to seize the Prytaneum, while the defenders try to hold them back.

The Defenders deploy their Detachments within any of the following Objective zones: Refinery Storage Vats, Prytaneum Entrance and Typhon Garrison-cloister. At least one Formation per Defending player must be deployed within the Typhon Garrison-cloister, and at least one Formation per two Defending players (rounding up) must be deployed within the Prytaneum Entrance. This can be multiple Formations from the same player, so long as the total number needed is met.

The Attackers then deploy their Detachments anywhere within the Lava Bed, Typhon Causeway or Causeway Beachhead. No Detachment may be deployed within 3" of an enemy Detachment.

Secondary Objectives are not used in this Mission.

**Conquest Areas**

Instead of Objective markers, this mission uses four 'Conquest Areas', which must be controlled to secure victory.

- The Causeway Beachhead and Typhon Garrison-cloister award Victory points at the end of each round.

- The Refinery Storage Vats and the Prytaneum Entrance only award Victory points at the end of the game.

Control of Conquest Areas is determined in a similar manner to Objective markers, with the Tactical Strength of all models within the Area used to calculate which side controls it. The side with the higher Tactical Strength controls the Conquest Area - unlike normal Objective markers a side does not need double the Tactical Strength to control an area. A Conquest Area is only Contested if the Tactical Strength of both sides is equal.

**Overwhelming Numbers**

*Magma City was a stronghold of Loyalist resistance on Mars and the Dark Mechanicum were intent upon conquering it.*

To represent this, when an Attacking Detachment is destroyed, place it to one side. At the start of the round if an Attacking player has three or more destroyed Detachments set aside, they may return them all to the battlefield.

The returning Detachments form a new Formation - this is an ad-hoc Formation, so has no special rules and does not have to match a Formation from any Army List. The returning Detachments are given Orders as if they were in Reserve and move onto the battlefield from the Attacker's battlefield edge. If a Detachment can enter Reserve using the [Deep Strike] special rule it may do so, but otherwise must move on from the battlefield edge.

**Scoring**

At the end of the second and each subsequent round:

- The Attackers score 4 VPs if they control the Causeway Beachhead and 8 VPs if they control the Typhon Garrison-cloister.

- The Defenders score 4 VPs if they control the Typhon Garrison-cloister and 8 VPs if they control the Causeway Beachhead.

At the end of the battle:

- A side scores 15 VPs for controlling the Refinery Storage Vats and 15 VPs for controlling the Typhon Garrison-cloister.

- The Attackers score 10 VPs for controlling the Causeway Beachhead and 30 VPs for controlling the Prytaneum Entrance.

- The Defenders score 10 VPs for controlling the Prytaneum Entrance and 20 VPs for controlling the Causeway Beachhead.

**Pyramid Defences**

When the Defenders are deploying their Formations, they may also deploy up to four defence guns across the Prytaneum Entrance and Typhon Garrison-cloister Conquest Areas. The defence guns are Fortification Structures no bigger than 2"x2" in area with a Garrison Number of 0.

During the First Fire stage, a Defending player may activate a defence gun instead of activating a Detachment and fire its guns, using the profile below. Each defence gun can only be activated once per phase.

| Weapon        | Range | Dice | To Hit | AP  | Traits               |
|---------------|-------|------|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Defence guns  | 20"   | 3    | 4+     | -2  |                      |
|               | 20"   | 5    | 5+     | -1  | [Anti-tank], [Skyfire]   |
