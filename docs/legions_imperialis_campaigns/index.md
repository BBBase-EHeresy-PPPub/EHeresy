Each Legions Imperialis battle represents just one of the clashes of the Horus Heresy and, with a few extra rules, players can link their games together to create a campaign. In doing so, you and your friends can forge your own story and determine the fate of a world or star system. Along the way, the outcome of each battle will affect the next, your armies reaping the benefits of victory or feeling the pain of defeat, with each player carving out their own tale to fit within the wider narrative of the Horus Heresy.

The following section includes rules for playing two different formats of Legions Imperialis campaigns: Warfront campaigns and Conquest campaigns. At the end of this section you will also find a series of Campaign Expansions. Each of these is a set of self-contained rules, which you can add to your campaigns to provide additional detail and gameplay options.

## KEY CONCEPTS

This section presents some key concepts which are common to all Legions Imperialis campaign formats.

### The Campaign Master

The Campaign Master is responsible for recording the names and armies of the players involved, communicating with the players, tracking victories and defeats, and helping schedule who is playing who and when. If your campaign only has two players, a Campaign Master is not required, otherwise one of the players must take on the role of Campaign Master.

### Factions

In order to fight a campaign, players will need to be divided into two Factions. There should be the same amount of players in each Faction. Each Faction must also have an Allegiance. One Faction has the Loyalist Allegiance and the other has the Traitor Allegiance.

### Campaign Cycles

Campaign Cycles are used to schedule games. Each Cycle represents a period of time during which each player should fight one battle.

If running a campaign with more than two players, then players should be encouraged to match up with a different opponent in each Campaign Cycle, at least until all players from one Faction have played against all players from the other.

### Campaign Points

These are usually the method by which overall victory in a campaign is determined, whether this is the Faction with the greatest number when the Campaign Cycle limit is reached, or simply a target number for each Faction to strive to be the first to reach. They are awarded for a number of reasons in campaigns, from winning battles to controlling territory on a map. Each campaign will detail how and when Campaign Points are awarded, and the Campaign Master should keep a record of how many each player has and the total for each Faction in the campaign.

### Requisition Points

Requisition Points are a resource used by players to add temporary Detachments to their Army. Each player tracks their own Requisition Points - a player can have a maximum of 300 Requisition Points at a time (any additional points gained over this total are lost). When a player spends Requisition Points, they should deduct the amount spent from their total. Each campaign format will explain how Requisition Points are gained and when they can be spent.

### Choosing a Campaign Format

When players wish to start a campaign, they will need to select the format the campaign will use and which, if any, additional sets of campaign rules, referred to in Legions Imperialis as Expansions, will be in use. You can find out more about Expansions on page 77. This book contains two different campaign formats.

The first format is the Warfront campaign on page 70. This is a very simple format in which players fight battles over a number of Campaign Cycles, with the side with the greatest number of Campaign Points at the end of the final Campaign Cycle being declared victorious. This campaign can be played with any number of players, but we recommend a maximum of eight.

The second format presented in this book is the Conquest campaign on page 71. This format uses a map which the players battle over, either going on the offensive or defending territories on that map until one side has reached a target number of Campaign Points and is declared the winner. The campaign presented in this book is for six players, but a larger or smaller map for more or fewer players can also be created.
