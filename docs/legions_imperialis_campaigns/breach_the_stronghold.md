## Mission Specifics

In this Mission, the Defender is considered to have control of the Battlefield and must deploy all of their Detachments within the Defender's deployment zone (with the exception of any in Reserves). The Defender can also deploy Infantry Detachments Garrisoning the Perimeter Wall Structures (as follows). The Attacker can deploy any of their Detachments in Reserves. The remainder of their Detachments must deploy within the Attacker's deployment zone.

Instead of determining Secondary Objectives as normal:

- The Attacker automatically has the Plant the Standard Secondary Objective.

- The Defender automatically has the Control the Battlefield Secondary Objective.

**The Perimeter Wall**

When terrain is being deployed, the players should also set up the Perimeter Wall on the battlefield. This is made of five Structure terrain pieces, placed side by side as shown on the deployment map opposite. The Perimeter Wall is considered to be wholly within the Defender's Deployment Zone. Four of these terrain pieces are Perimeter Walls, which should be 10" long, and one is the Gate which should be 8" long. These have the following Structure types:

| Structure Type | Armour Save (Sv) | Garrison Number (GN) | Wounds | Structure Bonus  | Cover Save |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|--------|-----------------------------|------------|
| Perimeter Wall | 2+  | 2   | 3 | -2 to Hit rolls <br> +4 CAF | 3+  |
| Gate  | 3+  | 0   | 2 | -    | -  |

At the start of each round, the player who controlled the central Objective marker at the end of the previous round (if it is the first round, the Defender can decide) can decide whether the Gate is open or closed:

- While the Gate is open, it is treated as open ground with no additional terrain rules.

- While the Gate is closed, it uses the Structure type above. If the Gate has lost any Wounds, these remain lost, even if the Gate is subsequently opened or closed. If the Gate collapses, replace it with an area of Difficult Terrain as normal. Once collapsed, the Gate can no longer be opened or closed.

Each Perimeter Wall Structure also has Wall Guns, which one Garrisoned model can fire instead of firing with weapons they are equipped with:

| Weapon | Range | Dice | To Hit | AP | Traits    |
|-----------|-------|------|--------|-----|----------------------------------|
| Wall guns | 20" | 3 | 4+ | -1 | [Light AT], [Point Defence]  |
|  | 20" | 2 | 5+ | -1 | [Anti-tank], [Point Defence], [Skyfire]|

In addition:

- Detachments from the Attacker's Army with the Outflank special rule cannot be deployed within the Defender's deployment zone.

- Detachments from the Attacker's Army with the Infiltrate special rule cannot be deployed within 12" of the Defender's deployment zone.

**Scoring**

At the end of the second and each subsequent round:

* The Attacker scores 4 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control.

* The Defender scores 2 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control.

At the end of the battle:

* Each player scores 5 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control.
