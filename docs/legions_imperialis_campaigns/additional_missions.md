In this section you will find a series of asymmetrical Missions intended for use in a Legions Imperialis campaign. These are designed to provide interesting scenarios for your campaign, such as ambushes or assaults on static defensive positions. Because the objectives of these Missions are different for each player, you may find that the forces required to succeed are a little different to what you might use in one of the Matched Play Missions presented [in the *Legions Imperialis Rulebook*](../legions_imperialis_rules/missions.md).

For each of these Missions, one player will be designated as the Attacker, and the other will be designated as the Defender. If you are playing one of these Missions as part of a campaign, the player from the Invading Faction is the Attacker and the player from the Protecting Faction is the Defender.If you wish to play one of these Missions as a
standalone battle, players can either roll-off to determine who will be the Attacker or Defender or simply agree between themselves.

One of the most fun ways to play asymmetrical Missions outside of a campaign is to play them one way around, and then swap roles, comparing results to see which player was the most successful in each role.

### Playing these Missions

These Missions use the same Mission sequence and rules as the Matched Play Missions found [in the *Legions Imperialis Rulebook*](../legions_imperialis_rules/missions.md), unless otherwise specified in the Mission. Any changes to this process will be listed under 'Mission Specifics' for that Mission.

## AMBUSH

**Mission Specifics**

In this Mission, the Defender is considered to have control of the battlefield and must deploy all of their Detachments within the Defender's deployment zone (with the exception of any in Reserves). The Attacker must deploy all of their Detachments within the two Attacker's deployment zones. Each time the Attacker sets up a Formation, they may select which of their two deployment zones it is set up in, though all Detachments from the same Formation must be set up in the same deployment zone (with the exception of any in Reserves), and each deployment zone must have at least one Formation set up within it if possible.

Instead of determining Secondary Objectives as normal:

- The Attacker automatically has the Control the Battlefield Secondary Objective.

- The Defender automatically has the Defiant Secondary Objective.

**Scoring**

At the end of each round:

- The Attacker scores 3 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control. They score 5 VPs instead if that Objective is within the Defender's deployment zone.

- The Defender scores 2 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control.

At the end of the battle:

- Each player scores 3 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that is not within the Defender's deployment zone that they control and 5 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that is within the Defender's deployment zone that they control.

**Fleeing**

In this Mission, each player has two battlefield edges. When a Detachment flees, determine which of the controlling player's battlefield edges is closest to the majority of models in that Detachment. Each model in that Detachment must move towards that battlefield edge. If there is no majority, the controlling player should randomise which battlefield edge that Detachment flees towards.

## STRONGPOINT DEFENCE

**Mission Specifics**

In this Mission, the Defender is considered to have control of the battlefield and must deploy all of their Detachments within the two Defender's deployment zones. Each time the Defender sets up a Formation, they may select which of their two deployment zones it is set up in, though all Detachments from the same Formation must be set up in the same deployment zone (with the exception of any in Reserves), and each deployment zone must have at least one Formation set up within it if possible.

The Attacker must deploy all of their Detachments within the Attacker's deployment zone (with the exception of any in Reserves).

Instead of determining Secondary Objectives as normal:

- The Attacker automatically has the Vital Intel Secondary Objective.

- The Defender automatically has the Control the Battlefield Secondary Objective.

**Scoring**

At the end of each round:

- The Attacker scores 3 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control. If the Attacker controls both Objective markers in the Defender's Forward deployment zone, they score 5 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control instead.

- The Defender scores 2 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control. If the Defender controls both Objective markers in the Defender's Forward deployment zone, they score 3 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control instead.

At the end of the battle:

- The Attacker scores 1 VP for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control in the Defender's Forward deployment zone, 2 VPs if they control the Objective marker in neither deployment zone and 4 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control in the Defender's Rear deployment zone.

- The Defender scores 3 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control. If the Defender controls all four Objective markers in their deployment zones, they score 4 VPs for each of these instead.

## PLANETARY ASSAULT

**Mission Specifics**

In this Mission, the Defender is considered to have control of the battlefield and must deploy all of their Detachments within the Defender's deployment zone.

The Attacker must deploy all of their Detachments in Reserve. Detachments which cannot normally begin the battle in Reserves gain the Outflank special rule, unless that Detachment is an Infantry Detachment that does not have any Dedicated Transport units, in which case it gains the Deep Strike special rule instead.

Instead of determining Secondary Objectives as normal, both players automatically have the Control the Battlefield Secondary Objective.

**Scoring**

At the end of the second and each subsequent round:

- The Attacker scores 3 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control. They score 5 VPs instead if that Objective is the Objective at the centre of the battlefield.

- The Defender scores 2 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control.

At the end of the battle:

- Each player scores 3 VPs for each Uncontested Objective marker that they control.
