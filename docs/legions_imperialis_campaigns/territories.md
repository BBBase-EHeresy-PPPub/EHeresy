The following section contains a list of territories which can be used in a Conquest campaign. A generalised example territory is shown below:

![](../media/legions_imperialis_campaigns/territory_example.jpg)

&emsp;1. The name of the territory, such as Hive City or Munitorum Depot.

&emsp;2. Information about the territory and what it represents.

&emsp;3. The number of Campaign Points awarded to the player in control of the territory during the Cycle End Phase of a Campaign Cycle.

&emsp;4. The terrain type. This provides guidance on how the battlefield should look when a battle is being fought over the territory. Terrain type is described in
two ways:

**- Open, Rugged or Urban**: Open represents wide open areas of land with scattered hills, rocks or woodlands. Rugged represents rocky outcrops, wooded areas, swamps or other naturalistic landscapes. Urban represents cities or other man-made areas.

**- Light, Medium or Dense**: This represents the amount of terrain that should be used. Light means only a sporadic amount of terrain should be on the table, Medium that at least a quarter of the table should be covered by an area of terrain and Dense should have at least half of the battlefield covered in terrain.

&emsp;5. This is the Requisition Points value of the territory.

&emsp;6. Any special rule that affects the player and/or Faction that controls this territory.
