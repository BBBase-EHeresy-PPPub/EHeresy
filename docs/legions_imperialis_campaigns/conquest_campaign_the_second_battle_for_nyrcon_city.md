In this section you will find a variant of a Conquest campaign for six players, allowing you to refight the Traitor assault on Nyrcon City in 012.M31. This will include a number of changes to the Conquest campaign format required to fight this unique variant, as well as a new territory specific to Nyrcon City and a new mission.

### Changes to the Conquest Campaign Format

The following changes apply when fighting the Second Battle of Nyrcon City campaign:

- Instead of building a campaign map, the Second Battle for Nyrcon City campaign uses the Nyrcon City Conquest campaign map [on page 128](#campaign-map-the-second-battle-for-nyrcon-city). This campaign map represents Nyrcon City and its surrounding areas and is divided into several rings of territories around the central Hive City territory, as shown on the diagram opposite. The six territories adjacent to the central Hive City territory are referred to as Inner City territories. The 12 territories around the outside of the map are referred to as Outer City territories.

- Instead of selecting starting territories as normal, the Faction Commander for the Loyalist Faction starts the campaign in control of the central Hive City territory, one other Loyalist player starts the campaign in control of the Nyrcon City Mag-rail Terminus territory, and the remaining Loyalist player starts the campaign in control of the Spaceport territory. Each Traitor player can select one Outer City territory to be their starting territory.

- In the first Campaign Cycle, the Traitor Faction is automatically the Invader (do not roll for this).

- In addition to the campaign ending when a Faction reaches the required number of Campaign Points, the Second Battle of Nyrcon City campaign has the following additional end condition:

**Sudden Death Ending**

At the end of any Campaign Cycle, if the Traitor Faction controls the central Hive City territory and all six Inner City territories, then the campaign ends immediately and the Traitor Faction is victorious, regardless of Campaign Point totals.

### New Territory

The following additional territory is in use in the Second Battle for Nyrcon City campaign:

#### Nyrcon City Mag-rail Terminus

| Campaign Points | Terrain Type | Requisition Points |
| :-------------: | :-------------:| :----------------: |
| 3 | Urban (Medium) | 20 |

**Special Rules**

When Invading, a player that controls the Nyrcon City Mag-rail Terminus territory may invade any Inner City territory rather than just those adjacent to a territory their Faction controls. When a battle is fought over the Nyrcon City Mag-rail Terminus territory, do not roll for a Mission. Instead, play the Seize the Terminal mission ([see page 86](../legions_imperialis_campaigns/additional_missions.md#seize-the-terminal)). The player Protecting this territory is always the Defender in this Mission.
