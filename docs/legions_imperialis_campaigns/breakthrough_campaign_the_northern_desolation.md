If players wish, when starting a Breakthrough campaign, they can instead fight the Northern Desolation campaign, representing the battles between Loyalist and Traitor forces on Tallarn prior to the crashing of the *Eagle's Talon*. This campaign is designed for six players, with three in each Faction.

### Ravaged World

Each battle in the Northern Desolation campaign uses the Fog of War additional rules, found on [page 72], including the optional Deadly Fog of War rules.

### Route Rules

In the Northern Desolation campaign, each battle has an additional special rule, depending on which Route that battle is taking place on.

**Sapphire Basin - Titan Graveyard**

All Difficult Terrain on this battlefield is also considered to be Dangerous Terrain, though it still grants Cover Saves.

**Khedive Range - Rocky Peaks**

Each time a model would lose a Wound as a result of Deadly Fog of War, roll a D6. On a 4+, that Wound is not lost.

**Khedive Plateau - Wreck of Victory's Sacrament**

The Cover Save granted by terrain features on this battlefield is improved by 1 (e.g., a Cover Save of 5+ is improved to 4+).

## Stronghold Assault

When a Faction launches a Stronghold Assault in the Northern Desolation campaign, additional rules will apply to the Stronghold they are assaulting. If the Loyalist Faction declares a Stronghold Assault, the Assault on the Sightless Warren additional rules are in use. If the Traitor Faction declares a Stronghold Assault, the Assault on the Rachab Fortress additional rules are in use.

### Assault on the Sightless Warren

When these additional rules are in use, the following applies:

* **Supporting Artillery**

In each Advancing Fire stage, instead of selecting a Detachment from their Army, the Defender can instead select to fire their supporting artillery. When they do so, they can fire the following weapon, measuring the range from their own battlefield edge. Attacks with this weapon are always made as if line of sight cannot be drawn to the target:

| Weapon  | Range | Dice | To Hit | AP | Traits   |
|---------------------|-------|------|--------|-----|------------------------|
| Supporting artillery| 90" | 5 | 4+ | -1 | Barrage, Light AT |

* **Local Knowledge**

Each time a unit from the Attacker's Army is set up using the Deep Strike special rule, the controlling player can re-roll the Scatter dice and/or D6 to determine the final position of the first model.

### Assault on the Rachab Fortress

When these additional rules are in use, the following applies:

* **Hidden Entrances**

Detachments from the Attacker's Army cannot select the Gate as a target unless they are within 12" of it.

* **Deadly Exposure**

At the end of each round, while the Attacker controls the central Objective marker and the Gate is open, the Attacker scores 2 additional Victory Points.
