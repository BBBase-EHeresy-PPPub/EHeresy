**Paragons of Duty:** Each Knight model within this Formation that has the Independent special rule always forms its own Independent Unit, even if there are several models within a Detachment that have the same name.

*For Example: A Questoris Knight Banner Detachment consists of one Knight Errant and two Knight Paladin models. As such the Detachment is formed of three Independent Units: a Knight Errant, a Knight Paladin and a Knight Paladin.*
