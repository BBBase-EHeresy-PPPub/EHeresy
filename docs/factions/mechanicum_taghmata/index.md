The following section presents the Mechanicum Taghmata Army List, representing the principal type of operational force of the trans-Martian Mechanicum at the outbreak of the Great Crusade. Within you'll find all the rules needed to build a Mechanicum Taghmata Army.

## Mechanicum Taghmata Special Rules

The Mechanicum, both Loyalist and Traitor, held close ties with both the Titan Legions and the Knight Households. Taghmata armies, and the twisted versions of them that marched to war during the Horus Heresy, were regularly supported by god-engines and knights, lending considerable strength to such armies.

To represent this, certain Mechanicum Taghmata Formations include Titan and/or Knight slots which can be filled with the appropriate Detachments taken from the Strategic Asset List (see page 198 of the *Legions Imperialis Rulebook*). Titans and Knights taken in these slots count as part of the Mechanicum Taghmata Army List; they do not count as, nor contribute towards the total points cost of, Allied Contingents if the Mechanicum Taghmata List is the Primary Army List. A Mechanicum Taghmata Formation taken as an Allied Contingent includes Titans and Knights within the allied points cost and restrictions.

Mechanicum Taghmata armies may still take Strategic Asset Formations as Allied Contingents following normal restrictions, allowing them to include Titans and/or Knights within their core list and as allies.

### Automata Detachments

Archmagos Prime, Archmagos Prime on Abeyant, and Tech-Priest Auxilia models may be attached to any friendly Infantry, Walker, Cavalry or Vehicle Detachment within the same Formation that has the [Cybernetica Cortex] (X) special rule. This overrides normal restrictions about joining Detachments of different types.

### Tech-Priest Auxilia

If a Support slot is filled with a Tech-Priest Auxilia Detachment, up to two additional Tech-Priest Auxilia may be included within the same slot. These Detachments count as separate Detachments but do not take additional slots.

### Cybernetica Cortex (X)

Detachments with the Cybernetica Cortex (X) special rule can only be issued an Order shown in brackets unless instructed otherwise. If a Detachment is not eligible to be issued any of the Orders listed - for example, if it is within a Transport and cannot be issued with anything other than the Advance Order - then this rule is temporarily ignored.

*Note: Cybernetica Cortex (X) is sometimes referred to as Cybernetica Cortex, such as within the Neutron-flux trait - this is the same rule.*

### Cortex Controller

If a Detachment with the [Cybernetica Cortex] (X) special rule has at least one model wholly within 8" of a friendly model with the Cortex Controller special rule, the former Detachment can be issued with any Order it would be eligible to be issued, instead of just those listed in brackets.

*Note: The Cortex Controller does not need to be part of the same Formation, merely the same Army.*
