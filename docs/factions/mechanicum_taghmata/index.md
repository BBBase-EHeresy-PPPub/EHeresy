The following section presents the Mechanicum Taghmata Army List, representing the principal type of operational force of the trans-Martian Mechanicum at the outbreak of the Horus Heresy. Within you'll find all the rules needed to build a Mechanicum Taghmata Army.

## Mechanicum Taghmata Special Rules

Some Mechanicum Taghmata Formations can include Detachments taken from the Knight Households and Collegia Titanica Army Lists. Titans and Knights taken in these slots count as part of the Mechanicum Taghmata Army List; they do not count as, nor contribute towards the total points cost of, Allied Contingents if the Mechanicum Taghmata List is the Primary Army List. A Mechanicum Taghmata Formation taken as an Allied Contingent includes Titans and Knights within the allied points cost and restrictions.

### Masters of Machines

Archmagos Prime, Archmagos Prime on Abeyant and Tech-Priest Auxilia models may be attached to any friendly Infantry, Walker, Cavalry or Vehicle Detachment within the same Formation that has the Cybernetica Cortex (X) special rule. This overrides normal restrictions about joining Detachments of different types.

### Tech-Priest Auxilia

If a Support slot is filled with a Tech-Priest Auxilia Detachment, up to two additional Tech-Priest Auxilia may be included within the same slot. These Detachments count as separate Detachments but do not take additional slots.

### Cybernetica Cortex (X)

Detachments with the Cybernetica Cortex (X) special rule can only be issued an Order shown in brackets unless instructed otherwise. If a Detachment is not eligible to be issued any of the Orders listed – for example, if it is within a Transport and cannot be issued with anything other than the Advance Order – then this rule is temporarily ignored.

*Note: Cybernetica Cortex (X) is sometimes referred to as Cybernetica Cortex, such as within the Neutron-flux trait – this is the same rule.*

### Cortex Controller

If a Detachment with the Cybernetica Cortex (X) special rule has at least one model wholly within 8" of a friendly model with the Cortex Controller special rule, the former Detachment can be issued with any Order it would be eligible to be issued, instead of just those listed in brackets.

*Note: The Detachment with the Cortex Controller special rule does not need to be part of the same Formation, merely the same Army.*
