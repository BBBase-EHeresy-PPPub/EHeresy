In addition to the possible ways to score Victory Points described in each Titandeath Mission, each player has a Secondary Objective. Secondary Objectives are chosen as described [on page 94](../titandeath/titandeath_battle_sequence.md#determine-titandeath-secondary-objectives).

Each of the Secondary Objectives are described over the following pages. If a Secondary Objective requires the placement of an additional Objective marker, then that marker must be clearly indicated as different from the Mission Objective markers. Any time a Secondary Objective marker is placed, either while setting up the battlefield or during the course of a battle, it cannot be placed within an area of Impassable terrain, overlapping or on top of a Structure or overlapping the base of any model. If the marker must be placed but does not meet these rules, move the marker the shortest possible distance to allow it to be placed.

Objective markers placed as part of a Secondary Objective do not score VPs due to the Mission rules - they are used solely for the Secondary Objective. However, players should still determine who is in control of each marker during the End phase of each round.

### Control the Battlefield

At the end of the battle, divide the battlefield into equal quarters and calculate the total Tactical Strength ([see page 96](../titandeath/titandeath_battle_sequence.md#capturing-objective-markers-in-titandeath-battles)) of each player's models that are wholly within each quarter.

The player with the greatest total Tactical Strength in each quarter is said to be in control of it - if the total Tactical Strength is the same, no player controls it. Note that unlike Objective markers, the Tactical Strength is not required to be double that of an opponent's models.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores 5 VPs if they control at least one battlefield quarter, 10 VPs if they control at least two battlefield quarters and 15 VPs if they control three or more battlefield quarters.

### Scan and Survey

At the end of each round, make a note of each uncontested Objective marker that you control for the first time.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores 3 VPs for each Objective marker that they have controlled at any point during the battle.

### Fresh Supplies

At the start of the battle, place an additional Supplies Objective marker in the centre of the battlefield, then roll a Scatter dice and 2D6 and move the marker that many inches in the direction indicated. If a Hit is rolled, the marker does not move. If the Objective marker would move into Impassable terrain, a Structure, or off the battlefield, reduce the distance moved by the amount required to not move into this terrain.

At the start of the second and each subsequent round, scatter the Objective marker again from its current location as described above.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores:

- 5 VPs if neither player controls their Supplies Objective marker.

- 10 VPs if their Supplies Objective marker is Contested.

- 15 VPs if they control their Uncontested Supplies Objective marker.

### Stand Tall

A player with this Secondary Objective must attempt to preserve their forces in the face of the enemy attack - most especially the pride of their Titan Legio.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle:

- If the player with this Secondary Objective has more than 50% of the total points cost of their Army on the battlefield, they score 10 VPs.

- If the player with this Secondary Objective has any Warlord Battle Titan, Warlord-Sinister Battle Titan, Warmaster Heavy Battle Titan or Warmaster Iconoclast Titan models on the battlefield and their opponent has no Warlord Battle Titan, Warlord-Sinister Battle Titan, Warmaster Heavy Battle Titan or Warmaster Iconoclast Titan models on the battlefield, they score 5 VPs.

### A Matter of Honour

After both players have finished deploying their Armies, the player with this Secondary Objective selects one of their models to be the Aggrieved. The model in their opponent's Army with the highest Wounds characteristic is the Miscreant. If two or more models are tied, their opponent can select which one is the Miscreant.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores:

- 5 VPs if the Miscreant model has suffered any Wounds.

- 10 VPs if the Miscreant model has been destroyed but not by an attack made by the Aggrieved model.

- 15 VPs if the Miscreant model has been destroyed by an attack made by the Aggrieved model.

### Break their Lines

After both players have finished deploying their Armies, the player with this Secondary Objective secretly selects three of their Titan models to be Linebreakers and makes a note of them. If the player with this Secondary Objective has less than three Titan models in their Army, they must re-roll this Secondary Objective.

**Scoring**

At the end of the battle, the player with this Secondary Objective scores 5 VPs for each Linebreaker model that is wholly within their opponent's deployment zone.
